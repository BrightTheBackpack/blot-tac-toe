run the site with yarn, or go to this vercel delplioyment https://blot-tac-toe-2sxa.vercel.app/ (although i'm now realizing you have to run your own site with yarn anyways because you have to put the url in step 3)

run the collab file(in the fodler called python)(upload the model first also in the python folder)

paste the link generated by the colab file into src/components/editor there a variable with the link

set up your stuff like this(use a whiteboard and thick marker or else its not gonna see the board)

adjust hte slider to around 200

hit the 2nd make new board button

connect the machine

hit run

if it says no board detected, try adjusting the slider untill you can see a solid colored line running around the board in the preview

make your first move

hopefully if it doesn't break, blot will make the next move, and you can keep going untill someone wins or its a tie! once the game ends, just wipe the board clean, and click make new board again
